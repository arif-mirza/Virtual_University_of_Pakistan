comunication at physical layar
Analog & digital data
analog =>  continuous hotahy infinte level of intensity over time.
digital => limited number of defined values

periodic & non-periodic signals 
periodic signal -> pattern
period and cycle
non-periodic -> no pattern

periodic analog signals
  -> simple or composite
simple periodic analog sigals -> sine waves

composite periodic analog -> composed of multiple sine waves

Sine Wave - peak amplitude and low peak amlitude

Sine Wave - Frequency 
  -> period (T) -> amount of time required to complete 1 cycle
  -> Frequency (f) -> no. of periods in 1 sec
  -> f = 1/t or T = 1/f
  ->  nomericals 

period & frequency units
s,ms,ns,ps = hz,khz,mhz,ghz,thz

phase (or phase shift) - signal ki shakal ko phase kahte hen. 

what is wavelength? apka connection kese ja raha
formula of wavelength : lamda = c/f
time and frequency domains

what is composite signals? 
what is decomposition of composite periodic signal?
what is bandwidth? how can we measure it? hz  or bps

how can we find the bandwidth of a composite signals? b = fh - fl
what is bit rate? transfer of bit in one second?

what is bit length? bit length =  propagation speed * but duration

what is transmission of digial signals? 
Two appraoches for transmisson: 
	baseband transmission
	braodband transmission

Transmission impairments konse hen? attenuation, noise, distortion
Attenuation formula? 10log10 p2/p1.
how to find db? formula?

topic 48 - 53

what is noise? how it affect?
noise - signal to noise ratio (SNR)
snr = average signal power / average noise power
examples by using snr formula

noiseless channel: Nyquist Rate formula & shannon formula
what is network performance?
there 3 characteristics: bandwidth + through put + latency
what is through put ?
what is latency?

what is delay - bandwidth delay product?

bandwidth-delay product 
volume = bandwidth * delay
delay - jitter? 



Topic 54 - 60

digital to digital conversion
 	data -> analog or digital
	signal -> analog or digital 
	digital transmission
	analog transmission
what is line coding, block coding , scrambling
-signal element vs data element

what is line coding? 
line coding schemes? 5 categories
	-unipolar  === nrz scheme
	- polar     === rz, NRZ
	- bipolar  === AMI or psedoternary
	- multilevel  === 2B1Q
	- multitransition
