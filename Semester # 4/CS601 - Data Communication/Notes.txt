Analog & digital data
analog =>  continuous hotahy infinte level of intensity over time.
digital => limited number of defined values

periodic & non-periodic signals 
periodic signal -> pattern
period and cycle
non-periodic -> no pattern

periodic analog signals
  -> simple or composite
simple periodic analog sigals -> sine waves

composite periodic analog -> composed of multiple sine waves

Sine Wave - peak amplitude and low peak amlitude

Sine Wave - Frequency 
  -> period (T) -> amount of time required to complete 1 cycle
  -> Frequency (f) -> no. of periods in 1 sec
  -> f = 1/t or T = 1/f
  ->  nomericals

 Analog-to-Digital Conversion 
	- types of digital conversations are 3 polar, bipolar and unipolar
	- Pulse Amplitude modulation (PAM)
		-pulses are still in analog we have to use PCM to make them digital.

Lecture # 17
Digital-to Analog Conversion
	- Variation in Characteristics of Sine Wave 
		- A sine wave is defined by 3 characteristics: (Amplitude, frequency, phase) 
	- Mechanisms for Modulating Digital Data to Analog Signals 
		- Amplitude shift keying(ASK) 
		- Frequency shift keying(FSK) 
		- Phase shift keying (PSK) 
	- Bit Rate & Baud Rate
		- Bit rate: no of bits transmitted during one second 
		- Baud rate: no of signal units per second that are required 


	Example 5.6 
	An analog signal carries 4 bits in each signal element.If 1000 signal elements are sent per 
	second, find the Baud Rate and Bit Rate? 
	Solution: 
	–Baud Rate= Number of Signal Elements   
	–Baud Rate =1000 bauds/second 
	–Bit Rate=Baud Rate * Number of bits per signal element 
	–Bit Rate= 1000 * 4 = 4000 bps

Lecture # 18
Summary 
Digital-to Analog Conversion 
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
	- varied to represent binary 0 to 1.
	- Both peak amplitude and phase remains constant	
	- Effect of Noise on FSK 
		- Avoids most of the Noise problems of ASK 
		-  Frequency Shift=Difference b/w two carrier frequencies 
		- BW= (fc1 – fc0) +Nbaud 
		- Example 5.11 (Find the minimum BW for an FSK signal transmitted at 2000 bps. TX is in half duplex 
mode and carrier must be separated by 3000 Hz )
		-Baud rate is the same as bit rate 
                            BW=2000 + (fc1 – fc0) = 2000 + 3000 = 5000 Hz  

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) 
	- varied to represent binary 0 to 1.
	- 2PSK (Binary PSK)
	- bit diagram and constellation diagram
	- Effect of Noise on PSK 
		- PSK is not susceptible to the noise degradation
		-  4PSK 
			- BW for PSK 
				- Minimum bandwidth required for PSK transmission is the same 
as ASK 
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) 
 	-Variation of QAM

	-  Bandwidth for QAM 
	- Bit Baud Comparison 
	- Example 5.11 
		A constellation diagram consists of eight equally spaced points on a circle. If bit rate is 4800 bps, what is the Baud Rate? 
	- Constellation indicates 8 PSK with the points 45 degree apart Baud Rate= 4800 / 3 = 1600 baud
